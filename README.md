## Publishing

The analytics package is published to npm as @dhis2/analytics.

To publish, simply mark the commit using [semantic release terminology](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) (see notes below for branch-specific restrictions). Once committed, github actions will take care of publishing the new version to npm.

### master branch

The master branch follows semantic versioning according to spec.

### 16.x.x branch

Commits to the 16.x.x branch cannot trigger a major version bump, even if it is technically a breaking change. This is because 17.0.0 has already been published. In the unlikely case that you need to commit a change that is considered breaking, you will have to mark it to only trigger a patch or minor bump, then make sure to update the apps that are locked to the 16.x.x version of analytics

### 11.0.x branch

Commits to the 11.0.x branch cannot trigger a major or minor version bump, even if it is technically a breaking or feature change. This is because 11.1.0 and 12.0.0 have already been published. In the unlikely case that you need to commit a change that is considered breaking or feature, you will have to mark it to only trigger a patch bump, then make sure to update the apps that are locked to the 11.0.x version of analytics

### 4.x branch

Commits to the 4.x branch cannot trigger a major version bump, even if it is technically a breaking change. This is because 5.0.0 has already been published. In the unlikely case that you need to commit a change that is considered breaking, you will have to mark it to only trigger a patch or minor bump, then make sure to update the apps that are locked to the 4.x version of analytics

### 2.4.x branch

Commits to the 2.4.x branch cannot trigger a major or minor version bump, even if it is technically a breaking or feature change. This is because 2.5.0 and 3.0.0 have already been published. In the unlikely case that you need to commit a change that is considered breaking or feature, you will have to mark it to only trigger a patch bump, then make sure to update the apps that are locked to the 2.4.x version of analytics
